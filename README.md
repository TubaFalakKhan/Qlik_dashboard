## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
As a **data and business analytics enthusiast**, I love exploring new tools whenever I get the chance.  
This was one of those **unplanned side projects** â€” an idea that popped up in my free time, and I ended up completing a full dashboard in Qlik Sense from scratch.

The project walks through:
1. **Data Loading** â€“ Importing CSV data into Qlik Sense
2. **Data Preparation** â€“ Basic cleaning & organizing
3. **Visualization** â€“ Creating charts, KPIs, and filters
4. **Dashboard Design** â€“ Bringing it all together into an interactive, visually appealing layout
